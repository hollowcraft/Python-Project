    "<p><span>Hey I know these guys! Crispybag understood the assignment and the other two submitted an assignment for a completely different class but all the screens were indeed bangers. Like I asked for a mcdouble and got a5 wagyu steak medium rare and i can’t complain but also I can’t wolf it down in one bite and rub my incel belly in such a restaurant unfortunately. Crispybag’s room was a great intro and made me smile a decent amount with its classically clean setups. Don’s room was prolly my favorite; it had such weird interactions and it was really fun to route despite not being balanced or jaunty at all. Noah’s room was also quite incredible to route with the most epic / quirked up dashless gameplay. Also even though it’s green gm+1, surprisingly well-balanced with the mostly wholesome backtrack. The deco is definitely a top contender; it feels very lush but not completely suffocating you with leaves thanks to the lack of bgtiles. I’m on a plane right now and I am going to slice this one baby’s head off. This map did a lot of cool things with the strictly horizontal screen progression; the use of teleporting and backtracking in the latter 2 rooms were both really impressive. However, I don’t need to tell you why this isn’t jaunty at all. Keep up the epic work tho ????</span></p>",
