This apple pie is made from 100% apples. You've  seen the thumbnail, but I have a feeling that some  
0:05
people might not quite understand what I mean  when I say this pie is made with 100% apples.
0:16
The filling is made from dehydrated apples  that have been rehydrated in apple juice and  
0:21
then reduced and then sweetened with reduced  apple juice and thickened with more apple. So,  
0:27
the filling is 100% apple. No sugar, nothing  else added. But of course, this the crust,  
0:32
isn't there? So, it's not really 100%. But no,  this crust is made from apples. Come with me on  
0:38
a journey to try to make the 100% apple pie. So,  here's a fun thing. Popped over to see a friend  
0:44
and neighbor the other day. He has loads of apple  trees and pear trees. He's kind of fed up with  
0:49
dealing with all of his apples and stuff now. And  so, he was kind enough to let me pick some apples.   So he said, "Yeah, take as many as you want."  So I was out there picking apples into this bag,  
1:00
which I happen to have in my pocket as he was  picking apples into a bucket. And we were just   chatting about apple varieties and such. And I  took these home and um about 5 10 minutes later,  
1:11
he turned up at my door with the bucket and he  said, "Now I intended you to have these." I said,  
1:19
"What? Instead of these?" He said, "No, as well as  these." So anyway, I've got an enormous quantity  
1:27
of apples and pears, the cockney fruit to deal  with. I've just dehydrated a lot of those apples  
1:33
and I'm just unloading the dehydrator now. Uh I  had to stack them neatly into the box like this  
1:40
or else it would have just overflowed. I haven't  shown the process of slicing and dehydrating these   apples because it's substantially the same as I  did for the mushrooms in that other video which  
1:51
is linked here. Anyway, I'm just unloading all  of these apple slices into storage. Now, I am  
1:59
noticing that down at the bottom of the dehydrator  here, the apple rings are were obviously exposed  
2:06
to a bit more heat and so these down here are  brittle. I want to try something with these while  
2:11
they're still nice and brittle and very dry. So,  that bottom layer, I'm going to try to run them  
2:16
through a food processor and grind them to powder.  I'm going to need a bigger box. But anyway,  
2:23
anything that will snap is going in that box.  But I'll check every piece because sometimes the  
2:28
thicker slices haven't dried all that well. That  one I'm not not even going to put into storage   because that is too moist. I'll just eat that now.  I think first we're going to try that with regular  
2:40
on the channel handheld blender. I have got a  little spice mill that might do a better job,  
2:46
but it's been used for spices and mushrooms  and I think if I try to use it for this,  
2:51
I'm going to end up with spicy mushroom flavored  apples, which is not quite what I want. So,
2:59
first let's get those into pieces, smaller  pieces. Now, if you buy dried apple rings in   the shops, they don't have this crunchy  texture. They're not as dry as this.  
3:08
And they put sulphites in those to preserve  them, which means I can't use them in this  
3:13
house because Jenny is definitely allergic.  Well, let's start with that much and see what  
3:18
happens. I suspect what will happen is this is  going to fly out. So, I'll probably do something  
3:24
like that to try to constrain it. Keeping my  fingers out the way of the blade, of course.
3:36
[Music] Well, it didn't not work. Now, if I  had one of those ninja things where you put  
3:42
the vessel clamped on the top, that would probably  work better. But I don't have one of those. Yeah,   I think I'm just going to get a piece of cardboard  to constrain the top of that because there  
3:50
are bits flying out. But it is working. Okay.  Actually, a bit of thin plastic, but that will do.
4:00
Well, we are ending up with something  like apple powder. It's Yeah,   that's not That's not bad. Let's  go a bit further if we can.
4:13
Right. Well, now I know that's working.  The rest of these apples are going to   go in there because I think I need  as much as I can get here. [Music]
4:29
Apple dust. Don't breathe this. That worked. We've got apple dust. Right.  I'm going to go as far as I can because I  
4:40
really want that to be reduced to  like a flower like consistency.
4:46
And then very importantly, that is going  to go into an airtight container before it  
4:51
absorbs any more moisture and cakes  off anymore. But yeah, there we go.  
4:58
apple powder. And just in case you're wondering,
5:04
tastes like apples. So, just  as a preliminary experiment,   I want to just try taking a bit of this apple  dust, which has got a real tendency to cake up  
5:15
because it is just powdered apple with all of  the sugar still in there. See how this behaves  
5:21
if we drip a little bit of water on it. What  I want to see is whether we can make a dough.
5:30
I'm working in this non-stick dish mainly because  well I thought I was going to be able to make  
5:36
this into a layer of some sort but okay fingers  now I think let's just see if we can knead this  
5:44
into some little some sort of layer because  the intention here is to make a pie crust.
5:55
I reckon we can do that. I reckon we can probably  mix it together like that to that consistency and  
6:02
just pat it onto this non-stick dish. I don't  think it's going to be a very strong pie crust  
6:08
because obviously this is just apples. There's no  flour in here. So, there's no gluten to hold this   together. There we go. So, we've got some sort of  pastry like obviously just smells of apples. Now,  
6:21
for the pie, we can't use water because that's  an ingredient that isn't apples. But we can use   apple juice. But first, I'm just going to  pop that in the oven for 10 minutes and see  
6:29
what happens. See how it dries out. See if it  just crumbles to pieces or whether that stays   in one piece or whether it sticks like glue  to this pan. So, experimental apple pastry.  
6:39
This is after 7 minutes in the oven. And it  did burn a little bit there. Um, it has gone
6:47
crispy, but that isn't going to come off the  bottom of the pan there. So, I'm just going to  
6:53
without scratching the nonstick, just going to  tease a bit off. That went on the floor. Let's  
7:00
try that again, shall we? Well, anyway, so we  have ended up with something that does hold  
7:06
together. Doesn't taste like pastry. It tastes  like apples, obviously. But we've got to figure   out this problem of it sticking to the pan. Right,  I think I have a plan for this entirely apple pie.  
7:15
The filling is going to be similar to something  I made in my cider making part one video where   I took some dehydrated apple. I rehydrated it in  apple juice which made it kind of doubly appley.  
7:26
Then I cooked it in more apple juice which I  reduced down which made it kind of three times   as appley flavored. That's where we're going to  start here. So, these apple rings here with the  
7:36
green skins. These are Bramley's, which is a  cooking apple commonly used for apple pies. It  
7:44
occurs to me I should probably explain a little  bit about dessert versus cooking apples. Uh,   since I don't think this is the same the world  over. So, these are dessert apples. These are  
7:53
possibly Brayburn or something like that. That's  a little undersized. That's a little oversized.  
7:59
Those are That's a dessert variety. Quite sweet.  This is a slightly less sweet dessert variety.   Not really sure what it is, but again, these  are what we call eating apples. Granny Smith  
8:09
is what we would call an eating apple. It is  a sour one that people often use for cooking,  
8:14
but it's not a cooking apple. This is a cooking  apple. This is Bramley's seedling. And it's,  
8:22
you can see it's not quite as round or neat and  tidy as the other ones. This is a small one. This  
8:27
is a small Bramley. It'll fit in the palm of my  hand like that. They get to maybe about this big.  
8:33
This apple, I would hesitate to say this is only  used for cooking because there'll be people down   in the comments right now saying, "I like to eat  Bramley's just as they are." More power to you.  
8:42
But Bramley seedling, this apple is one of a quite  a large number of what we call cooking apples,  
8:49
cooking varieties, culinary apples. There are  varieties that have been bred to be cooked in  
8:55
pies or baked or, you know, used in sauces, those  sorts of things. Usually they need a bit of sugar  
9:00
added for most people's taste. Often they have  a particular behavior when they're cooked. So  
9:07
some cooking apple varieties dissolve down into  apple sauce really easily. Others keep a nice firm  
9:13
texture that would be quite good for apple chunks  in an apple pie. Bramley, arguably the most common  
9:18
and popular cooking apple variety, is a really  good allrounder. It retains enough of its texture  
9:24
when it's cut into chunks and cooked that it's  good in apple pies. You could get a little bit   further. it will break down into a sauce. And it  has a distinctive apple flavor. I think a lot of  
9:34
people in the UK associate with the flavor of  apple pie. When we think of apple pie flavor,  
9:39
we're partly thinking of Bramley. Anyway,  that is cooking apples versus eating apples   or dessert apples. So, we'll start with some of  those. Shall I put some red apples in as well?  
9:49
In fact, no, let's not because the crust  is going to be made from powdered apples,  
9:56
which is a mixture of brownies and dessert apples.  The juice that we're going to rehydrate this in is  
10:02
from a mixture of apples. But let's make the apple  pieces themselves, all of these green apples,  
10:08
because then we've got a little bit of difference  between the filling, everything else in the pie,  
10:14
bearing in mind it is all going to be apple. And  then I've got some apple juice. This was frozen.   This is the second to last liter of apple juice  I've got from that cider pressing. It's been  
10:26
in the freezer. There's still a little bit of it  slightly frozen, but mostly thought out now. So,  
10:32
that's going to go over the top of these  apple pieces. Just weigh those down like  
10:41
that to keep them immersed. And then that's  going to soak for well overnight at the very  
10:49
least. Got about half that apple juice left. These  are my Bramley apple slices that have been soaking   overnight. Nice and floppy now and rehydrated,  but rehydrated with apple juice. So doubly appley.
11:05
I drain that off into the pan because  we're going to use that apple juice   that's remaining for the sauce. So, I'm  going to put that on the stove and start  
11:14
that reducing before we do anything else. If  you can hear white noise in the background,   it's pouring with rain here today. So, this  is a pleasant Sunday afternoon activity,  
11:25
making weird apple pies. Feel like I won't  use that bit in the pie. It's just a bit   discolored. So, now I'm going to cut these up  into little cubes for my apple pie filling.
11:39
And at the moment, they're still quite woolly, but  when that other apple juice has reduced a little  
11:46
bit, I'll cook them in there for a bit. They  will absorb some more liquid and the texture  
11:53
will change a bit. Anyway, that's what I'm  doing now. I'm just going to dice these into   little uniform dice. Skins are staying on.  I wouldn't always do that in an apple pie,  
12:01
but this is going to be quite well cooked.  that juice that was left over from the soaking,   which may be not exactly apple juice  because something soaked into the apples,  
12:09
maybe differentially. I think that's  sufficiently reduced for now. So,   the apple pieces can go in there, which is  going to take it off the boil for a moment
12:22
because they're cold. So, that's the apple pieces  in. Now, I'm just going to cook this, simmer it,  
12:29
and reduce it. The apples will probably swell up  a little bit more and absorb some of the juice,  
12:34
but also I want to drive off the water out of here  and make it more sticky and syrupy. This is not  
12:40
how I would normally make a filling for an apple  pie, but if I was making a filling for an apple   pie conventionally, this might be the point where  I would add some spice. Maybe ground mixed spice,  
12:50
maybe cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, something  like that. I'm not going to do that today.  
12:56
Not because I don't like those flavors, but  because this pie needs to be 100% apple. I  
13:03
switched to a slightly larger pan just because,  well, when when these apple pieces swelled up  
13:08
a little bit, the liquid wasn't evaporating off  the top because there was just a layer of apple   on top of the the liquid. It wasn't reducing  at all. It was just boiling underneath. So,  
13:19
this is actually now cooking and reducing at  the same time. It looks like it's going to   come together about right. There's still way  too much liquid in there at the moment. So,  
13:28
we'll just keep going. That's really not far off  now before it actually boils completely dry. We're  
13:34
just going to have a slight interlude for handheld  blender. I want this apple pie filling to have a  
13:40
sauce to it. So, I'm going to very briefly blend  some of these apples. Not the whole lot. Just like
13:53
that. Three little blips. That's  a bit more like it. Right now,  
13:59
back to the cooker just to reduce that a bit more.  And this will have to be stirred constantly now,  
14:05
or else it will catch and burn. So, I think we're  getting close. I do need to make my filling a bit  
14:10
thicker than it would normally be in an apple pie  because of what the crust is going to be made of.   I think we'll stop there because it will carry  on drying out a bit as the steam dissipates. Now,  
14:22
the tricky part, which I think stands to  be the fun part, too. So, my apple powder.
14:31
So, it did occur to me I could just get a little  dish, put some of this apple pie filling in the  
14:38
bottom of the dish, sprinkle some of this apple  powder on top, and call it apple crumble. And  
14:45
done. But anyway, I'm going to attempt to make  apple pastry. Now, when I did this on the dummy  
14:53
run, I used water to hydrate that. Obviously,  I can't do that now because we are going for   100% apple pie. No other ingredients, not even  water. Apples contain water, but apples are not  
15:05
water. So, anyway, we're going to hydrate this  with apple juice. Just to keep faithful to the
15:16
100% apple attempt. Going to make this relatively dry. It  does need a little bit more than that. Right. So,  
15:28
we've got some sort of apple dough there. Now,  because of the amount of sugar in there and I   think also the cellulose will have trouble getting  that to not to stick to a non-stick surface. So,  
15:38
I do have a cunning plan for this. We will just  temporarily line that pie dish with cling film.  
15:48
We'll have a Does that look about the right  amount of crust in there? Let's assume it  
15:55
is. The other layer of cling film across  the top like that. Then second pie dish.
16:11
Try to force that up the sides and make a  pie case like that. Let's see how that's   working. Is it working? Well, almost. Actually,  maybe what I need to do first is just Yeah,  
16:22
massage it over the tops like  that. Yeah, that'll do it.
16:32
Okay. Now, I could just oil these or butter these  dishes and that would stop this from sticking more  
16:38
than likely. But again, we are in this 100% apple  mode. Therefore, we can't do that. Right. Okay.  
16:49
Another plan is required. At least I know this  is releasing okay from the cling film. So, this  
16:56
was the bag from inside a cereal packet um which  happened to split all the way along the scene.  
17:03
What we'll do, I think, is roll that  out in between. Start again with a  
17:09
ball. It's really not got any doughiness  to it because it is just apple. And then  
17:15
what we'll attempt is to just roll that out  with a rolling pin between the two sheets.
17:29
[Applause] pretty good. Think we're getting  somewhere. It looks like it's about  
17:38
the right diameter. Maybe a bit more cuz  it's got to drape down into the pie dish.
17:50
So, that comes off of there. Okay. One film  onto that side up and over and then [Applause]
18:07
come on. That's a Oh, come on. Stuck to that side then.  Wow. Did I mention this is sticky? All right.
18:25
I kept finding myself thinking, if only  we could flour the work surface. We can't   because obviously flour would be a non-apple  ingredient except except if it's apple flour.
18:43
Now I've made this dough. I've added  some more dry ingredient to this as   well. So this is now a bit drier as well.  which may make it more crumbly or it might  
18:53
make it just firmer. Here goes. A little  dusting of apple flour on the top too.
19:09
[Applause]
19:17
That part appears to have worked. I  still don't want to put this directly   into this pan because it will just stick.  I'm certain of it. However, hopefully now
19:32
we can ease this crust into place. Well, that  went a bit smoother that time. That seems like  
19:40
it's working. Just got to make sure it's all  the way down to the bottom so we don't put any   stress on it. I'll just flatten off this top  here so that we ready to accept a top crust.  
19:52
I think while I've been fiddling around anyway,  I think the filling is actually cooled down. So,  
19:57
I'm going to do the same again. I'm going to make  some more apple pastry for the top crust. Getting   a bit low on apple dust now, but I can always  make some more. All right, here we go then. So,  
20:05
that's my top crust ready. Just offer that up  and make sure it's big enough. It's not quite big  
20:10
enough. Just roll it a little bit further that  way. apple filling into my apple bottom crust.
20:25
I'll fill that right up to level. This it  pie is only going to get baked enough to  
20:33
crisp up the crust because everything  else is already cooked. [Applause]
20:45
top crust on the top and press it down.  And then if I can I'll get this sheet up.
20:59
Oh, this is fragile. [Applause]
21:09
[Applause] Come on. Not happening.
21:23
Knife perhaps.
21:33
Okay, I can still patch this up. So,   I haven't given up yet. That is  a mess. But we can patch this up.
21:48
So, I'm just going to take these  pieces of pastry off the edge here   like this because I will use those  on the top to patch up this crust.
22:02
Yeah, I think we're going to get away with this at least so far.
22:10
Yeah, it's not going to have any  kind of integrity at all. So,  
22:17
I think what I may have to do is build it up  in layers. So, apple juice. Brush that on.
22:28
Apple powder.
22:38
Dust it on. Press it down. Okay. Well, it's it kind of looks  a bit like a pie. We're not remotely out of the  
22:49
woods yet, though. However, let's give it  a little crimp around the edge if we can.
23:01
Something like that. I think maybe another  layer of apple juice just to try to bind  
23:10
that apple dust together. And then one last  little dusting if there's enough in there.
23:24
All right. Now, how the heck are we  going to cook that? Good question.  
23:32
Baking tray. Non-stick reusable baking  liner. These are usually super nonstick.  
23:41
I'm making sure I haven't got  the cling film tucked under.
23:47
Invert that onto there. The dish should just come  off because that's just held on with a cling film.  
23:54
And I'm going to bake it upside down. I say bake  it. I'm going to attempt to bake it upside down.
24:08
I think it might work.   Okay, that's going to go in a low oven, probably  like 150° C for as long as I dare. I'm not sure  
24:21
this is a good idea. In fact, I'm not sure any  of this project is a good idea, but I am going to   pierce a little steam vent in the top here because  I definitely don't want this bursting. That is  
24:32
obviously going to be the bottom of the pie when  it's cooked, but we won't see that bit. Okay.
24:39
Oh, I can see it. Oh, no. I think those are  creases actually rather than cracks. Anyway,   good luck little pie. I'll check  on that after 10 minutes. Right,  
24:48
that's after 10 minutes of cooking. And I actually  turned it down because I don't want the insides to  
24:54
boil. It is dry on the outside now. I don't  know that we're going to get it crisp there.  
25:02
And I can't really take it any further. So, I'm  probably going to stop there. We will get the  
25:08
top crisp because I can put that underneath the  grill. I've just got a little bit more dough.
25:16
I'll just paper over the cracks here. Okay,  I just ate raw dough. How about that? Um,  
25:25
right. I'm going to leave that to cool. I think  we're cool enough to handle now. So, here goes.
25:36
Oh, cracked. Darn it. Okay, that's  going to go onto there like that. I  
25:45
think actually this may turn out to be a disaster,   but I'm just going to slip it in there now that  that bottom is dried up. That will constrain it  
25:53
into pie shape. Only the top is now going to  receive further baking. Just going to see if  
25:59
we can actually repair this crack. I think I  might glaze the top with apple juice anyway.
26:08
Although that is all soaking in Okay,
26:20
we actually got the rather coarse  pieces of apple now. Let's just  
26:27
see if we can do a little repair job  there. Just smoosh that back together.
26:36
That might do the job actually. And then  perhaps we'll just have a a little sprinkle   of those bits on top just to make it look  a bit more crusty or something. That's now  
26:50
going to go under the grill on a low heat just  really to dry that out and try and crisp it up.
27:02
Okay. Owing to the nature of the everything,  this is not going to go crispy. It has dried  
27:09
out and it has browned. I dare take it  any further than that or else it will just  
27:14
catch. You can already see it's actually  started to toast a little bit in places.   That's as far as I dare take it. Anyway, I'm  going to leave that to dry out now and then  
27:24
we'll give it a taste. The dish is now cool  enough. I'm going to try and turn this out.
27:38
Is it going to come out? Has it wedged itself in there? Oh, good. Okay.  Well, it's out in one piece. Is back over again.
27:52
So, here is the finished 100% apple pie. So,  got a little bit of crispiness to the crust.  
28:02
Not as much as I would have liked, but  it is a crust. Next thing I think I need   to do is just try to cut a photogenic  wedge out of here for the thumbnail.
28:22
Well, there we go. 100% Apple pie. I wonder what it tastes like.  Brace yourself for this revelation. It tastes  
28:37
of apples. What else could it taste of? The  experience is pie. There's a crust here. Look,  
28:47
they're a little bit doughy, but that's because  of the journey we've been through. You watch   the whole process, you know why that happened. The  flavor is just intense, complete apple. It's quite  
29:00
remarkable actually. There is nothing to get in  the way of the apple flavor. The apple filling is   a little bit on the sharp side because we used  the brownies rather than the dessert apples,  
29:08
but there's no sugar. There's no added sugar  in this. It's just the natural sugars in the   apples. There is nothing except apples in  here. And yeah, it tastes sweet enough and  
29:17
it does taste kind of like a pie. The illusion of  pastry is definitely there. This little part was  
29:23
recorded afterwards in case you're wondering why  there's a continuity issue with the completeness   of the pie. This is not one of my criteria for  whether something is a pie or not. But you can  
29:35
pick up a slice of this and eat it with more  or less the same handling and properties as  
29:41
you would have with a piece of genuine apple  pie with a pastry crust. I think it's a pie.
29:50
So Jenny actually asked to try a little piece  of my 100% apple pie and enjoyed it. And Jenny  
29:55
agrees that this is definitely a pie. We are  definitely experiencing pie when we eat this  
30:01
despite its unusual composition. So there we  go. That is the 100% apple pie. I don't know
